# GymApp

This is a Web App made with ASP.NET(MVC) using the .NET 6 framework. I tried recreating my first CRUD(create/read/update/delete) app, this time using the newest framework .NET 6.

After launching the VISUAL Studio 2022 and installing all the packages needed for the asp.net core you can safely build the project(***CTRL + SHIFT + B***) and run it(***CTRL+F5***)

In order to access the page with the database you need to add /gyms at the end of the starting page URL(https://localhost:1234/Gyms). 1234 is just an example of a local host.

I chose to use this app to keep track of the workouts including the name of the exercise, repetitions, sets and also weight.

The first ones are added by me manually in VISUAL STUDIO, but at the moment I'm having some trouble adding a new column(in this case weight was added later than the first columns)
and as you can see some values are 0.

But, if you add them in the web app you should not have any problems with the weight being 0.

After that, besides the availabile buttons create/delete/edit/details you have on the top left some filter searches for the muscle groups and for exercises you're looking for
in the database
